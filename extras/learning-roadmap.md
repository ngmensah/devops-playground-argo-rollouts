# 🧠 Learning Roadmap: After This Lab

## ✅ Core Concepts You Just Practiced
- Canary deployments with Argo Rollouts
- Pre-promotion gating using AnalysisTemplates
- Local cluster setup with Kind
- Prometheus as a deployment gatekeeper

## 🚀 Suggested Next Steps

### 1. CI/CD Integration
- Trigger rollout updates via GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

### 2. Helm Chart Deployments
- Package rollout as a Helm chart
- Template values like image tag or analysis interval

### 3. Argo CD + GitOps
- Use Argo CD to manage and sync this deployment
- Learn GitOps workflows with app-of-apps pattern

### 4. Production Readiness
- Integrate external metrics (Datadog, CloudWatch)
- Add traffic-shifting using ingress controllers (like Istio or Kong)
- Add HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

### 5. Kubernetes Certification
- Study for CKA or CKS exams with real projects like this
